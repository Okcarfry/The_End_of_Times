                The first crazy fact can be traced back all the way back to the stone age, actually before that, like way before that. Around 10 billion years ago there was this very tiny
                entity, around the size of your dick, which cotained everything that exists in our universe, and one day, it expanded in an instant to an unfathomable size, around the 
                size of your mom. That's one of the craziest facts out there, and it's the oldest crazy fact we know of. During the course of billions of years, a bunch of other crazy
                facts occured, to see those feel free to visit the physics tab.
