            Graham's number, the number at the top of the screen, is the largest finite number that has been used to solve a problem. These arrows ↑ indicate raising to the power of the following number. When there is more than one arrow, it indicates
            raising to the power of the power of the following number. So 3↑↑3 can be written as: 3↑(3↑3) which would be 3↑27. This would then mean that 3↑↑↑↑3 can be written as 3↑(3↑(3↑(3↑3)))
            which results in a tower of approximately a billion threes. This is as you would expect a pretty big number. As you can then see you will produce a 3 followed by that insane number
            of arrows followed by another three. This is an even more absurd number. You follow this process 64 times to reach Graham's number. This is a pretty big number, in fact, it's so big
            that there's not enough space in the observable universe to write it out if each digit was a planck length, which is the smallest space physically possible. Actually there isn't enough 
            space in the observable universe to write the value for the number of digits in G. So this is a really huge number, in fact it's so big that if you were to process all the information
            required to know this number, your brain would turn into a black hole.
